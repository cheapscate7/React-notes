## This project is a sort of clone of google keep

The aim was to create a notes app that visually looks simular to google Keep, using React Native, with some minor changes. Also not all functions are recreated (such as reminders and a few things to do with google drive). Also the notes are currently global and do not change depending on user.

## TODO
* make "add note" button actually do something
* allow pictures to be added
* allow pictures and audio recordings to be taken as a reminder
* add labels or note colours
* delete and edit notes
* add option to change how notes are displayed (list and masonry)
* store the notes somewhere that isnt just a javasript object
